# skygear-cf-demo

**The naming is made up by myself, feel free to suggest some better names.**

```
- examples
  - docker # I just copied it from an openfaas template
  - flask
  - js
  - js-fn
- skycf.yaml
```

### `skycf.yaml`

This file contains the configuration that `skycli` (TBD) would read when executing operations, e.g. deploy.

### `examples/xxx`

Each folder contains the source of a `service` specified in `skycf.yaml`.
